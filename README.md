<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A web application to visualize important graph algorithms like Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Search Algorithm on a 16x32 grid. 
<br>
<br>
There is a source node and a destination node and and the user can add obstacles and place bombs on empty cells to make path finding harder for the algorithms to perform. 
<br>
<br>
The motivation behind creating this project was to visualize and compare the behaviour and performance of different pathfinding graph algorithms in a dynamic and interactive manner.

<!-- There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
